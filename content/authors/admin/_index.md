I am an epidemiologist specialising in the use of big data and advanced analytical approaches to study immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. My work focuses on understanding variation in disease manifestation, treatment response, and healthcare delivery by applying methods such as latent class modelling, regression discontinuity designs, causal inference techniques, and other modern statistical approaches.
Alongside my research, I serve as a statistician within clinical research teams. I design statistical components of clinical trials and carry out analyses, and I provide expert statistical support to clinical researchers in the design and interpretation of observational studies.
Through this combined work in epidemiology, data science, and biostatistics, I aim to advance evidence-based practice and support innovations that improve outcomes for people with chronic inflammatory disease.
